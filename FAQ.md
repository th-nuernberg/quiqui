### How do I open a quiz fastest during the lecture?

Bookmark your full teacher URL — the one that already contains your question repo, e.g.:

```
https://kiz1.in.ohmportal.de/quiqui/<teacher-slug>?repo=https://github.com/you/quiqui-questions
```

Opening it pulls your questions and shows the QR code automatically — no further setup. Save it as a browser bookmark or drop it on your laptop or phone home screen, and you're one click from a running session at the start of every lecture.

### Can I use generative AI to create questions?

Yes. Use the AI assistant of your choice (ChatGPT, Claude, …) to draft your questions, then commit the result to your question GitHub repo. QuiQui's YAML format is simple and LLMs generate it reliably.

There's a ready-made prompt that describes the exact format — copy it from **[Generate questions with an AI assistant](https://github.com/th-nuernberg/quiqui-questions#generate-questions-with-an-ai-assistant)** in the question repo, fill in your topic, and paste the assistant's output into a `.yaml` file.

### How do I show images or figures in a question?

Put the figure on a slide and show it the usual way, then use QuiQui just for the question and answer options. QuiQui questions are text (with Markdown and LaTeX), so for visual material your slides and QuiQui work side by side: the figure on the beamer, the live poll on the phones.

---

### Can I build graded tests with multiple questions that students complete on their own?

No. QuiQui is a live, teacher-paced response tool with no login, and it deliberately stores no per-student results — votes are anonymous and vanish when the session ends. If you need self-paced tests with grading and a gradebook, use Moodle or a similar platform instead.
